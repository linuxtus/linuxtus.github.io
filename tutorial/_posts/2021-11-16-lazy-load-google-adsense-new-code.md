## What is Google Adsense

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AdSense), Google AdSense is a Google program that allows website publishers in the Google Network of content sites to serve text, image, video, or interactive media advertisements that are tailored to the content and audience of their sites. Google is in charge of administering, sorting, and maintaining these advertisements.

Google AdSense is a program that allows publishers to profit from their online content. AdSense works by finding ads that are relevant to your site's content and visitors. Advertisers who want to promote their products create and pay for the ads. The amount you earn will vary because these advertisers pay different prices for different ads.


## How does Lazy Loading works

To increase performance and save system resources, lazy loading is the technique of postponing the loading or initialization of resources or objects until they are really needed. For example, if a web page contains an image that requires the user to scroll down to see, you can show a placeholder and then lazy load the complete image once the user reaches the desired spot.

## Steps to Setup Lazy Loading for Google Adsense

> If your website is making money that depends on Google Adsense, you shouldn't follow these steps, because it can reduce your earning money rapidly, but your website will load very fast.

### 1. Remove your default Google Adsense code

By default, Google Adsense provides this code to use their's service

```
<script async='async' data-ad-client='ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxx' src='https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js'/>
```

Here Google Adsense also delay code by adding `async='async'` but it is still not optimized, because the ads still load on same page, which making the page heavy and taking a long time to finish loading the page. To Lazy Loading Google Adsense and improve your page's speed, you should remove this code, and replace with these below code

### 2. Replace with new Google Adsense code

After removing the old code, you need to replace with these code to apply lazy loading for your page. You should put them above `</body>`  

```
<script>
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    var is_adsense_load = 0

    window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
      if (is_adsense_load == 0) {
        is_adsense_load = 1;

        var ele = document.createElement('script');
        ele.async = true;
        ele.src = 'https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js'
        var sc = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]
        sc.parentNode.insertBefore(ele, sc);

        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({
          google_ad_client: "ca-pub-xxxxxxxxx",
          enable_page_level_ads: true
        });
      }
    })
  })
</script>
```
